# Cleo

**THE MOD REQUIRES [Kokoro](https://github.com/Shockah/Cobalt-Core-Mods/blob/master/Kokoro).**

**Cleo** -- Your shopkeeper. Capable of *upgrading* and *downgrading* cards mid-battle.

Core mechanics:
* ![](icons/Improved.png) **Improve**: Cleo's main method of upgrading your cards. It will always target the rightmost eligible card in your hand, upgrading it to the letter specified. 
* ![](icons/Impaired.png) **Impair**: The opposite of Improve. Downgrades your rightmost eligible card to its non-upgraded version. Always has some other benefit following suit if you can successfully impair a card.
